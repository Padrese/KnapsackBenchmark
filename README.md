# KnapsackBenchmark

Benchmarking attempt of Linopy and Pyomo models of the knapsack problem.
So far, the project is ongoing, the models are created and both Pyomo and Linopy models can be solved successfully.
However, the project currently face issues as performance issues from my personal computer arise when benchmarking on large models. This should be investigated as soon as possible.
